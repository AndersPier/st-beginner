My name is ***Anders Lehmann Pier***. I work as a **Cloud Architect / Solution Architect & DevOps engineer** at ***[IBM](https://ibm.com)***. You can check out my own **fully automated DevOps deployed Streamlit site**, at my ***[Test Lab](https://streamlit.pier.dk)***.

I like to experiment with different technologies, such as **Automation, DevOps, Machine Learning, Generative AI, etc.** within the IT space.
This repo contains ***Anders Lehmann Pier's*** test applications, made with ***[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)***.

***[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)*** is a *free and open-source* framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps, but can also be used for rapid prototyping of regular web apps.  
You can find the ***[official Streamlit repo here](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)***.
